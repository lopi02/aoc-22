# Advent of Code 2022

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. 

I implement my solutions with Java.

## Structure

- createTask.java: Creates a new class ("src/dayXX.java") and a new input file (in "inputs/dayXX") for the **current** day XX. Updates the TaskRunner.
- TaskRunner.java: Runs all classes
